# dabbington-backend
Backend for Yelp Data visualization application.

## Setup
Steps below are from the [official Flask documentation](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/installation/). 
Setting up a virtual environment is recommended. What I think it does is allow for backwards compatibility since
Flask may not work with Python 3, but regardless you might as well do it. It's 2 lines.

`virtualenv venv`

`. venv/bin/activate`

To deactivate the virtual environment:

`deactivate`

After activating the virtual environment (or not setting it up at all, like I did), run the following commands:

`sudo easy_install pip`

`pip install Flask`

You should be good to go!
